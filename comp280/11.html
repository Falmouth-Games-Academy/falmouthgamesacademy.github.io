    <b>Lecture:</b> </br>
    This week introduces the final specialism of this module: Interfaces and Interaction. As a 
    specialism, Interfaces and Interaction is heavily embedded in field of study known as 
    Human-computer interaction (HCI). According to the ACM definition HCI is, "a discipline 
    concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems 
    for human use." This week's lecture will provide a general introduction to HCI.

    design.
