    <b> Lecture: </b><br />       
    This week we will assume the position of expert and interrogate user-interface (UI)
    against a set of heuristic. The Heuristic Evaluation, a process made famous by Nielsen,
    is a type of qualitative research that draws upon the experience and knowledge of
    experts to identify UI issues early on in the design stage. This lecture provides the
    theory and methodological insight required to carry out a heuristic evaluation 
  </p>
  <p>
    <b> Workshops: </b><br />
    The first workshop this week focuses on the actual implementation of a heuristic evaluation.
    You will be tasked with evaluating a UI based on a given set of heuristics and then sharing 
    the results with your peers.  
  </p>
  <p>
    The second workshop this week introduces another very useful method for testing UI: analytics. 
    We will explore the tools available in Unreal Engine and the potential to hook these up with 
    cloud services in order to collect valuable data about the users interactions. We can use this
    data to make decisions about game balance and usability.
