    In this session, as a group, alongside your peers from other disciplines, you will pitch a new game design to panel of creative directors. 
	This is an important opportunity to develop your innovation and creative flair with respect to design.
	Please note that the design that you propose in this session is the design that you and your team will take forward to prototyping in the studio practice period after Christmas.
