      This session is an assessment of your technical competence and communication skills. 
	  Its primary purpose is to detect academic dishonesty and plagiarism; however, it is also an opportunity to receive one-on-one feedback from your tutor and explore how to improve your programs in the future. 
	  You must attend your scheduled slot. 
	  Failure to attend (in the absence of mitigating circumstances) will result in penalties being applied to your coursework grades.
