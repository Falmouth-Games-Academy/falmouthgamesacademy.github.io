      This session is an assessment of your technical competence and communication skills. 
	  Its primary purpose is to detect academic dishonesty and plagiarism; however, it is also an opportunity to receive one-on-one feedback from your tutor and explore how to improve your programs in the future. 
	  You must attend your scheduled slot.<br/><br/>
	  Failure to attend (in the absence of mitigating circumstances) will result in penalties being applied to your coursework grades.
