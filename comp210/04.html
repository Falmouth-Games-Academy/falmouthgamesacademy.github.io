    This session is dedicated to support for writing the usability report. This is
    not an optional drop-in session and attendance is mandatory. You will be given
    the time and support you need to finalise your reports ready for the peer review
    in the week following. You are expected to bring research data to this session
    but if you do not have any data yet, then you are still required to attedn and
    this is not an excuse not to.
