  <b>Study Support</b>
  <p>
    Social distancing provides considerable challengers for user testing. These challenges are amplified when it
    comes to immersive tech due to sharing of equipment and the site specific nature of most installations. However, 
    there are plenty of methods for gaining insight into the sentiments of the end user without the requirement for
    particpants to attend in person. Today's session will consist of one-to-one study support sessions to discuss 
    your individual test plan and how you will proceed with your project given the present situation with Corona.
