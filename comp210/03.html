    This week we investigate the psychological and physiological factors involved in making users feel 'present' within virtual worlds
  </p>

  <b>Lecture: </b>
  <p>
    When it comes to virtual worlds, positioned anywhere along the reality continuum, the main aim is to facilitate an
    environment where the user forgets that the experience is in anyway mediated by technology. This might seem like a beg
    challenge but luckily, humans are extremely good at suspending disbelief. There are many psychological factors at play
    and this week we will deep dive into the psychology of feeling present in virtual worlds.
  </p>
  <b>Workshop: </b>
  <p>
    Taking into consideration the discussions from week 1, we will explore various forms of locomotion and player
    perspective within immersive environments. We will also experiment with some passive haptics and monitor their
    effectiveness.
