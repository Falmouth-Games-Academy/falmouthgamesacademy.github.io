  <b> Lecture: </b>

    The process of designing, planning and carrying out data collection is only half the battle. Once all the data is in, it
    needs to validated, cleaned, transformed, visualised and interpreted. In this session we will cover some basic
    techniques for validating, visualising and interpreting data.

    The workshop this week, you will experience play testing first hand. You will put the Augmented Telegrapher prototype

    of planning that is involved in implementing play testing.
