      This week you will go with Ed Powley to ProcJam.

      <a href="http://www.procjam.com/" target="_parent"> PROCJAM Website </a>

      <h2>Event Format</h2>
      <p>Below are the details about how our event works. They&#8217;re kinda like rules, but we encourage you to break them if it helps you have a good time and make cool stuff. There&#8217;s no winner or loser in PROCJAM, so the format is really just there to help people get organised. Don&#8217;t let it get in the way of fun!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>PROCJAM takes place across nine days, including two weekends.</li>
        <li>You can enter anything you like, as long as it has something to do with procedural generation/random generation/generative software/things like that. Art, boardgames, tools &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t have to be a game!</li>
        <li>You can use existing code, art, or anything else you need.</li>
        <li>You can even take an existing game and add some generative magic to it for the jam!</li>
        <li>If you need to start before the jam, or you want to finish later, go for it!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>The PROCJAM Community</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can submit your entries via <a href="http://www.itch.io">itch.io</a> to let people play them (you don&#8217;t have to, though). There&#8217;s no ratings but people can leave comments and say hi.</li>
        <li>A lot of PROCJAM chat happens on Twitter! Use the #procjam hashtag to show off what you&#8217;re up to.</li>
        <li>During the jam we&#8217;ll try and have an IRC channel set up so people can chat and share.</li>
        <li>Don&#8217;t forget, our live day of talks takes place in London and you can come along! Watch out for ticket announcements on Twitter and here on the blog.</li>
      </ul>


      <!--


      This session is split into two parts. First, you will receive a guest lecture from
      an industry expert in AR/VR. The second part of the session will be dedicated to the
      interface evaluation viva. The viva is an assessment of your technical competence and
      communication skills. Its primary purpose is to detect academic dishonesty and plagiarism;
      however, it is also an opportunity to receive one-on-one feedback from your tutor and
      explore how to improve your research in the future. You must attend your scheduled slot.
      Failure to attend (in the absence of mitigating circumstances) will result in penalties
      being applied to your coursework grades. -->
