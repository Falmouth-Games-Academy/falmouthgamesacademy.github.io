  <p>
      This session is split into two parts. First, you will receive a guest lecture from
      an industry expert in AR/VR. The second part of the session will be dedicated to the
      interface evaluation viva. The viva is an assessment of your technical competence and
      communication skills. Its primary purpose is to detect academic dishonesty and plagiarism;
      however, it is also an opportunity to receive one-on-one feedback from your tutor and
      explore how to improve your research in the future. You must attend your scheduled slot.
      Failure to attend (in the absence of mitigating circumstances) will result in penalties
      being applied to your coursework grades.
