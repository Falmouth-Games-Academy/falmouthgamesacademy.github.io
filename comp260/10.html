    This session is the third of three to explore computer networking in depth. 
	You will explore issues associated with multiplayer security, paying particular
	attention to encryption, authentication, and avoiding common attacks such as man-in-the-middle. 
	This will provide even further insight into the design of the architecture of your
	client for the educational MUD.
