      In this session, you will review the MUD server and journal-in-progress that 
	  you have produced together and
	  reflect on the key challenges that you encountered. You are expected
      to provide insight into the architectural quality of the distributed system as well as evaluate
      the quality of the source code. This is an important opportunity to receive
      feedback on your programming practice and to improve the MUD server (and 
	  critically its API, which you will be using to implement your clients) prior to submission.
