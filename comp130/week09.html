	<p>
		This is a joint session with BA Games Development. <br /><br />
		
		Teamwork is core to both the games industry and this degree. 
		Without strong teamwork your projects will falter, especially over the longer term, 
		but being able to put forward exemplary teamwork is no easy feat. 
		In this session we'll discuss ways to make your teams stronger, 
		as well as share examples of what methods have worked well for improving teamwork, 
		approaches to managing conflict and how to rehabilitate those who may have strayed from the team.
