		This session discusses the fundamentals of game engine design.
		Nowadays very few game developers implement their own game engines from scratch.
		However an understanding of the principles of game engine design
		will help you understand why general-purpose engines such as Unity and Unreal
		are structured the way they are, and allow you to adapt and troubleshoot the
		engine more easily.
