  <p>
      In this session you will---with your team---demonstrate your collaborative game projects.
      This is an exciting opportunity to show-off your progress, get some feedback from tutors and peers,
      as well as play-testing to improve the design and highlight bugs. Please use the latest stable build
      of the game project. 
  </p>
 
   <p>
     Students enrolled on COMP130, COMP230, COMP240, COMP330, and COMP340 will also showcase posters that 
     describe their individual contributions and/or innovate technology that they have incorporated into their
     projects.
  </p>
  
   <p>
     However, it is also an opportunity to see what other developers in the Games Academy are working on.
     As such, you are <b>required</b> to attend for the entire day. 
     Throughout the day, you will either be playing or presenting!
  </p>
     
   <p>
     The day is arranged into three parts, each corresponding to modules at particular stages of the degree
     ---first-year students in the morning, second-year students in the afternoon, and final-year students in the early evening. 
     Different members of staff will come to different sessions to review all of the games for a particular
     module. The team <b>must</b> be present at these review as feedback will be provided in person. The agenda is as follows:
