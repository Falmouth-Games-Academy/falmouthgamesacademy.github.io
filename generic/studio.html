  <p>
      This week is designated as a studio practice week, hence there is no timetabled session.
      Use the time to work on your assigned collaborative game development project in the studio.
      Please note that you may work in the studio, in any of the labs, or in the library.
      You have a responsibility to your peers to be physically on-site, though you can choose to work
      in a distributed fashion with the consent of your peers.
