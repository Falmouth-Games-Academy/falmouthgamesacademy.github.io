  <p>
      In this session we will conduct vivas of your work based on the assigned tasks. 
      Please note it is the artefacts that you have
      produced that are under assessment, 
      and you are not at all being marked on your performance on the day. 
      The viva serves as an opportunity to:
      explore your working practice and feed back to you;  
      highlight interesting challenges and accomplishments;
      discuss how you approached the task and what you learned;
      and identify further opportunities for personal development.
      You need not do anything specific to prepare, however it is advisable that you familiarise
      yourself with the codebase if you don't feel comfortable describing it.
