        <h3>VR110 Week 3: Immersion vs. Presence</h3>
        <p>This week we compare and contrast the terms immersion and presence to help us better understand the requirements of immersive systems.</p>
        <h3>Lecture</h3> 
        <p>Teleporting the user into new worlds can be an exciting prospect but it is vital to remember that we are dealing with real people. We must ensure that we keep the user at the center of the design process and ensure their comfort and safety. In order to do this, we must consider human factors when working with immersive systems. This week we will explore the human factors of VR though the terms, immersion and presence and begin to create a set of guiding principes for good UX.</p>
        <h3>Workshop</h3>
