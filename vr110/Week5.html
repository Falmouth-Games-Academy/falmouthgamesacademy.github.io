        <h3>VR110 Week 5: HCI</h3>
        <p>This week we look at how traditional HCI research can inform the design and implementation of immersive experiences.</p>
        <h3>Lecture</h3> 
        <p>As with any emerging field, immersive tech draws upon many different established fields to help accelerate progress. One such field is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) -  the study of design for computer technology and, in particular, the interaction between humans (the users) and computers. This week we will lean upon some key texts in this field to establish some guidelines for best approaches to UI in VR.</p>
        <h3>Workshop</h3>
        <p>This week we will take a look at how traditional games feedback key information to the player and how we need to adapt, design this for VR.</p>

        <ul><li>Unity</li></ul>

        <b>Learning Objectives:</b>
        <p>By the end of this week you should be able to:</p>

        <ul><li>Define the terms affordance, signifier and feedback</li><li>Create interactables in Unity</li><li>Recall usability best practices for immersive experiences</li></ul>
