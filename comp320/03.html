		This session covers the philosophical underpinnings of research as understood in terms of ontological, epistemological,
		axiological, and inferential positions. 
		A clear, detailed, and justified methodology is critical to the integrity of the claims made in the dissertation,
		and so this forms an essential foundation to the research project write-up and the dissemination of your work.
