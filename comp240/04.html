  <p>
    Research is fundamental to a science degree. 
	Computing professionals are not merely consumers of knowledge, but also <i>producers</i> of knowledge. 
	Beyond research in technology, which you will study in depth next year, such professionals also conduct research in the commercial and humanistic domains. 
	Today's session focuses on human research, drawing a distinction between different research designs, with a focus on quantitative and qualitative measurement.
	This is important as it will help you inform the market evaluation and business case for your written project.
