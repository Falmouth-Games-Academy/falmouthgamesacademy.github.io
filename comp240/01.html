  <p>
      Digital games and digital game technology do not exist in a vacuum. 
	  They are, for the most part, commercial products and/or services.
	  The game developers need to fund their craft, and make money.
	  This requires a level of commercial awareness when embarking on game development projects.
	  As such, this session emphasises the importance of evaluating a market and striving to develop a sound business case. 
	  It will also introduce the key deliverables of the production project.
