  <p>
      In this session, you will individually pitch your pre-production project idea. 
	  Further to this, you will plan your first sprint and start research for your academic essay. 
	  It is critically important that we kick-start these activities early in the semester. 
	  You will be leveraging skills that you learnt last year and applying them, so you are already equipped with most of what you need. 
	  However, as it is a long-term software development project, the course will expect more of you, so start early! 
	  Additionally, you will be expected to integrate new knowledge from your companion modules, and will not have the time to do this if you commence the project at too late a date.
