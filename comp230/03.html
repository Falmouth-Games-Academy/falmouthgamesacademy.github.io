    This session introduces ethics and professionalism in the computing context, framing them as topics that can be explored through Bohmian dialogues. 
	An awareness of ethical and professional issues in the games industry is important because they will influence your future working practice and job satisfaction. 
	You also will need to appreciate the extra level of intellectual freedom that is expected of you, and the format of dialogues will help you to develop this independence.
