		In this session you are expected to bring a final draft of your dissertation and will conduct a peer review.
		This is a valuable opportunity to receive feedback on your research findings.
		Alongside feedback and suggestions to improve the dissertation, each of your peers will be asked to recommend whether to:
		accept the dissertation; accept the dissertation subject to minor revisions; accept the dissertation subject to major revisions;
		or to reject the dissertation. It will be up to authors to ensure that the claims they are making are relevant and 
		well-justified.
