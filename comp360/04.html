	<p>
		This session covers the expectations that Falmouth University and the British Computer Society have in respect
		to software quality and how you assure quality in your final-year project. The final-year project epitomizes your 
		ability to deliver a substantial piece of software as an individual endeavor, and as such presents a key point at 
		which you demonstrate your learning of computing fundamentals. Although many of you will already be testing your 
		software as a matter of practice, and there will be variations in your approach depending on your project, this 
		session outlines how to demonstrate and evidence your software testing process.
	</p>

	<b>Learning Objectives:</b>

	<p>By the end of this session, you should be able to:</p>
