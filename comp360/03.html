	<p>
		This session covers the underpinning characteristics and qualities of the written research dissertation, 
		outlining how your work will be assessed and why such an approach is taken. This informs a review of 
		two exemplar dissertations, which each possess strengths and weaknesses. This helps to form your ability 
		to analyse research quality and therefore assess the quality of your own work and your peers' work.
