	<p>
		This session covers how to write with clarity and authority, revisting material on scholarship and academic writing.
		A dissection of publication resulting from an undergraduate final year project provides a benchmark and constast against
        which you can analyse your own work and writing ability. Hopefully inspiring fervour and aspiration.	
		It then goes on to formalize the management of the software development life cycle.
		A clear, detailed, and justifiably valid approach is critical to the integrity of the claims made in the dissertation,
		and so this builds on research philosophy to forms a core foundation to the research project and 
		eventual dissemination of your work.
